# Migrate Stack

Perform a full audit of the current codebase, then write a migration PRD with /ralph-tui-prd using context7 to learn both the source and target stacks.

## Frontend migration

Audit and plan migration of a frontend codebase from one framework to another.

### FR

```
Perform a full audit of the @src/ folder to understand the current Angular codebase (architecture, components, routing, state management, dependencies), then write a PRD in the @tasks folder with /ralph-tui-prd to migrate to Next.js with React and TailwindCSS. Use context7 to deepen your understanding of both Angular and Next.js, and use the /next-best-practices skill as reference.

## Backend migration

Audit and plan migration of a backend codebase from one framework/language to another.

### FR

```
Perform a full audit of the @backend/ folder to understand the current Fastify/Node.js codebase (architecture, routes, middleware, database layer, dependencies), then write a PRD in the @tasks folder with /ralph-tui-prd to migrate to Rust with Axum and SeaORM. Use context7 to deepen your understanding of both Fastify and the Rust stack (Axum, SeaORM, Tokio).

```

## Full stack migration

Audit and plan migration of both frontend and backend in a single PRD.

### FR

```
Perform a full audit of the entire codebase to understand the current stack (frontend: @src/ with Angular, backend: @backend/ with Fastify/Node.js — architecture, components, routes, database layer, shared types, dependencies), then write a PRD in the @tasks folder with /ralph-tui-prd to migrate the frontend to Next.js with React and TailwindCSS, and the backend to Rust with Axum and SeaORM. Use context7 to deepen your understanding of both the source and target stacks.
